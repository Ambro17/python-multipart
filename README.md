# Python-Multipart

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/andrew-d/python-multipart.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/andrew-d/python-multipart)

This project is a streaming multipart parser for Python.  It's still under some development, but test coverage is currently 100%.

## Why?

Because streaming uploads are awesome for large files.  Examples will be coming soon :)
